# numerical-optimization-of-likelihood-function-to-find-MLE-of-LAD-estimator
For econometrics, MLE Is a very popular estimating technique, in which not all estimators have closed form solutions. With these types a numerical optimization approach is needed.  The example I am doing is the MLE of the LAD estimator.   I will be maximizing the LAD loglike function to find the maximum likelihood estimate.  Since the log likelihood function is an absolute value function, it’s derivative cannot be taken hence no closed form solution. We’re trying to find the max likelihood of theta given x,y. I managed to construct an algorithm, in which I have created random samples of X and Y using the random and distributions packages.  The only parameter that must be maximized is beta. I created two functions, first the regular log likelihood function and the second the first order conditions for the log likelihood function. Again, since the likelihood function has abs value the derivative cannot be taken, but an approximation can be created using Newton’s difference quotient seen in figure 2.  With this function, I run it through the bisection function, and I run the log likelihood function through the optimize function, my results are in Figure 3. In which a maximum for theta is .0202 for both techniques.
